# Syntheix

Syntheix specializes in advanced, bare-metal virtualization orchestration and infrastructure management. We build robust, scalable control plane solutions designed to bridge the gap between high-performance hardware and intuitive cloud-centric operations.

## Engineering Philosophy

Our architecture is built on principles of decentralization, resilience, and operational efficiency. We focus on low-latency telemetry, resilient agent-based hypervisor integration, and centralized orchestration capable of managing complex, multi-node environments at scale.

- **Distributed Control Plane**: Centralized orchestration providing complete visibility and deterministic control over distributed infrastructure.
- **Agent-Driven Hypervisor Management**: Lightweight, secure node agents interfacing directly with industry-standard virtualization suites (KVM/QEMU/libvirt) for optimized resource allocation.
- **Enterprise-Grade Observability**: Real-time telemetry, continuous health monitoring, and seamless state synchronization across the entire infrastructure topology.

## Engineering Standards

We leverage modern, performant stacks to deliver uncompromising reliability:
- **Core Orchestration**: Go
- **Virtualization Ecosystem**: libvirt, QEMU, KVM
- **Management Intelligence**: Next.js, React
